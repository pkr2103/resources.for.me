It seems like you have data from illumina snp arrays where the results are exported from genomestudio. Theta value is the same as b allele frequency. it ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the fraction of bases that are genotyped as the b allele (variant allele). 0 means homozygous reference (AA), 0.5 means heterozygous (AB) and 1 means homozygous variant (BB). The R value represents the fluoresence intensity of that probe of that sample. The log R ratio was obtained by dividing the R value of your sample by a baseline (maybe your matched control) and represents the ploidy (copy number) of your sample at that genomic position. LRR of 0 means copy number neutral, positive values mean copy number gains, negative values mean copy number losses
